List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members. [1,2,3]
Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members. (1,2,3)
Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members. {1,2,3}
Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members. {"a" : 1, "b": 2, "c" : 3}


File I/O Mode

 The argument mode points to a string beginning with one of the following
 sequences (Additional characters may follow these sequences.):

 ``r''   Open text file for reading.  The stream is positioned at the
         beginning of the file.

 ``r+''  Open for reading and writing.  The stream is positioned at the
         beginning of the file. No truncate (not delete the file)

 ``w''   Truncate file to zero length or create text file for writing.
         The stream is positioned at the beginning of the file.

 ``w+''  Open for reading and writing.  The file is created if it does not
         exist, otherwise it is truncated (Delete the file).  The stream is positioned at
         the beginning of the file.

 ``a''   Open for writing.  The file is created if it does not exist.  The
         stream is positioned at the end of the file.  Subsequent writes
         to the file will always end up at the then current end of file,
         irrespective of any intervening fseek(3) or similar.

 ``a+''  Open for reading and writing.  The file is created if it does not
         exist.  The stream is positioned at the end of the file.  Subse-quent
         writes to the file will always end up at the then current
         end of file, irrespective of any intervening fseek(3) or similar. No truncate.

 * Difference between r+ and w+ are r+ do not create a new file if it does not exist but w+ do


 * file handling with "with clause"
    - It automatically close the file.
    - Better for handling multiple files.


# in-place method (it modifies the original set).
# non-in-place method (it returns a new set).


 * Iterable
 An iterable is any object in Python that you can loop over using a for loop.
    For example:
    A list is iterable: for item in [1, 2, 3]:
    A string is iterable: for char in "hello":
    A file object is iterable: for line in file:

 * Module
  Module (likely a code library) is a file written by another coder that normally has functions to use later on.
  Example: os, tensorflow(work with machine learning) etc
